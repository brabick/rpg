Next steps for program (in no order):

#Add the ability to choose pokemon for both sides.
-->You can choose your mon, the opposing mon is chosen at random

Expand type chart and super effective calc

Add effects and more variability in attacks * This is going to be difficult

Add more pokemon

Build an interface (long term project)

#Figure out how to make it so that a mirror match has two different sets of hp(!important!)
-->I created another instance of each pokemon with two different lists.  This fixes this issue.

#Make information more accessable (wait statements?) Print turn over?
-->Prints a random statement at the end of each turn that helps to break up the battle

#Print when an attack is super effective!
-->Added

#Make the battle flow and have the next pokemon sent out when one faints.
-->After one of your pokemon faints, it is removed from the list and you are asked to enter the name of you next pokemon.
  This goes until the list is empty.  With the opponent, after their pokemon faints they send out another random pokemon
  from the list.  This works but the turn doesn't stop if a pokemon faints.  The incoming pokemon then uses the attack
  that is then performed by that pokemon.

Create attack called faint that is perfomed when a pokemon faints. This will override the attack text.

Reorganize main game turns such as:
    while (game not over):
        turn1()
        if (game is over):
            break
        turn2()

    if (you won):
        print("You won!")
    else:
        print("You suck!")


New battle notes
When I knock out the opposing mon first:
I send char, they send char
hydro cannon
opp char faints, blas comes out
frenzy plant
opp blas faints, ven comes out
blast burn
ven faints win
Working as intended

When opp knocks me out first
i send char, they send ven
hydro cannon
char faints I choose blastoise
blas comes out
i choose hydro cannon
Venusaur uses hydro cannon?
Blastoise uses hyper beam? (doesnt have hyper beam)
Mons are switched
